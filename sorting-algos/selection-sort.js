/**
 * Easiest of the sorting algos:
 * Suppose the list is [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]:
 * 
 * Find the smallest: 11. Swap it with the first number → [11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
 * 
 * Find next smallest in rest: 12. Swap → [11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
 * 
 * Next smallest is 22. Swap → [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
 * 
 * Continue until the list is fully sorted....
 * 
 * Summary of Key Ideas:
 * Always pick the smallest (or largest, if sorting in reverse) from what's left.
 * Move it to its right position.
 * Repeat until the list is sorted.
 * Works well for learning, but is slow for very big lists.
 * 
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n^2)
