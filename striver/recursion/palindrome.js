/**
 * Recursion:
 * - Function calls itself
 * - Base condition to exit
 * 
 * Given a string s, return true if the string is palindrome, otherwise false
   A string is called palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

   Examples:
   Input : s = "hannah"
   Output : true
   Explanation : The string when reversed is --> "hannah", which is same as original string , so we return true.

   Input : s = "aabbaaa"
   Output : false
   Explanation : The string when reversed is --> "aaabbaa", which is not same as original string, So we return false.
